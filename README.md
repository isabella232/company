# What is this?
This is the Tilt company handbook. It documents _how_ we work at Tilt. The actual work (e.g. product changes) that we plan and execute is tracked in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill).

# How do I use it?

Tilters should know and follow the processes outlined here as much as possible. It is the source of truth of how we try to act and expect others to act. We recognize that there's a lot of content and may not be caught up all the time. If you see a fellow Tilter deviating from a process, send them a kind reminder and link to the specific section.

# How do I change it?

If you think a given process can be improved, suggest a change in this handbook by creating a PR. Invite other Tilters to discuss the change to get buy-in. We currently don't have a strict approval process, so use your personal judgement to decide when a PR should be merged. Once a PR is merged, the process is officially changed and Tilters should [abide by the new process](#how-do-i-use-it). Consider sharing the change broadly so everyone knows.
