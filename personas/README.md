# Personas

Personas are a representation of an archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. It’s important that the Persona is as realistic and believable as possible.

A Persona’s story can include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, background information or environmental details – it should be context specific and include anything that makes most sense for your product, service or challenge. These may vary by industry, user or customer type, goal to achieve and communication channel. 

Additional items such as a photo, quote or more personal details help a fuller more realistic Persona and can help empathise with the user. Empathy leads to better designs and solutions.

This information is best gathered from research, user conversations or interviews and represented real target audience data. The more accurate the representation, the better the Persona’s story and the easier it will be to make good decisions about the needs of your user.

Rather than speculating if a feature or communication is best, the Persona can function as a reminder of who you are serving and help standardize needs and get to solutions faster. 

Persona’s can
* Provide direction for decisions making by validating or disproving new ideas
* Help communicate findings, decisions and rational across your team
* Vet and prioritize feature requests
* Be a place for inspiration and ideation
